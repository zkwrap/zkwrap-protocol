# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts
```

contract on testnet =  0x451d1aF630eD72C6506c969e471c3d81F5932F6B

prev tx test = 0x0a642cdc3b5562b816c1d556920fac50f0eb56f4f95634f8cee77cc2d83ced25
